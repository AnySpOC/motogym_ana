# Moto Gym Ana

Moto Gym Ana is a browser-based moto gymkhana timing prototype for iPhone.
It uses only built-in iPhone motion/orientation sensors to detect start,
stop, acceleration, braking, banking, and turning events.

## Files

- `index.html` - app screen
- `styles.css` - layout and visual design
- `app.js` - sensor filtering, event detection, timer, CSV export
- `server.mjs` - local static server

## Local check on PC

```powershell
cd C:\app\gym_ana\repo
node server.mjs
```

Open:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:4173
```

Use the demo button first. It replays synthetic riding data and should create
START, ACCEL, TURN, BANK, BRAKE, and STOP events.

## iPhone check

1. Put the PC and iPhone on the same Wi-Fi.
2. Start the server on the PC.
3. Find the PC Wi-Fi IPv4 address with `ipconfig`.
4. Open this URL in iPhone Safari:

```text
http://PC_IPV4_ADDRESS:4173
```

Example:

```text
http://192.168.1.23:4173
```

If the page opens but sensor permission does not appear, use HTTPS. iOS Safari
often blocks DeviceMotion / DeviceOrientation on plain HTTP LAN addresses.

## HTTPS option for iPhone sensors

One quick option is ngrok:

```powershell
cd C:\app\gym_ana\repo
node server.mjs
ngrok http 4173
```

Open the generated `https://...ngrok-free.app` URL on iPhone Safari, then tap:

1. Sensor permission
2. Arm timer
3. Move the iPhone forward to trigger START
4. Keep it still to trigger STOP
5. Export CSV after the run

## Safety

For real riding tests, mount the iPhone firmly and test in a safe closed area.
Do not operate the phone while riding.
